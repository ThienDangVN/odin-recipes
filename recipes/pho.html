            <ol class="list-elements">
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
                </li>
    
                <li>Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until browned, about 1 hour.
                </li>
    
                <li>Place onion halves on a second baking sheet and roast on another rack until blackened and soft,
                    about 45 minutes.
                </li>
    
                <li>Transfer beef bones and onion halves to a large stockpot. Add ginger, salt, star anise, 
                    fish sauce, and 4 quarts water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 to 10 hours
                    . Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.
                </li>
    
                <li>Place rice noodles in a large bowl filled with room temperature water. Let soak for 1 hour. Drain.
                </li>
    
                <li>When noodles have soaked for 1 hour, heat up the reserved broth by bringing it to a simmer.
                </li>
    
                <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles in the boiling water for 1 minute. Drain.
                </li>
                
                <li>Divide noodles among 4 serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and green onion. Ladle hot broth 
                    over the top. Stir and let sit until beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes.
                </li>
    
                <li>Serve with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and chile-garlic sauce on the side.
