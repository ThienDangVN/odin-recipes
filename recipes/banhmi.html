        <h2><strong>This is an example of a traditional Vietnamese</strong></h2>
        <p>Banh mi is a staple breakfast food in Vietnam! They are found on almost every sidewalks in Ho Chi Minh City.
            It typically contains fresh vegetables, pickled carrots and daikons, a type of meat, all wrapped in a frech styled baguette.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 carrot, sliced into sticks</li>
            <li>1 daikon (white) radish, sliced into sticks</li>
            <li>1 cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish sauce)</li>
            <li>8 sprigs fresh cilantro with stems</li>
            <li>1 medium cucumber, sliced into thin strips</li>
            <li>2 (7 inch) French bread baguettes, split lengthwise</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place the mushrooms on a baking sheet. 
                Drizzle with a little olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast in the preheated oven 
                for about 25 minutes. Cool slightly, then slice into strips.
            </li>
            <li>While the mushrooms are roasting, bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Plunge the carrot and 
                radish sticks into the boiling water and after a few seconds, remove them and plunge them into 
                a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. In a separate bowl, stir together the rice vinegar, 
                1/2 cup of lime juice and 1/2 cup cold water. Transfer the carrot and radish to the vinegar and
                 lime marinade and let them soak for at least 15 minutes, longer if it's convenient.
            </li>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir together the remaining lime juice, soy sauce, fish sauce, sesame oil, 
                canola oil, 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup water. This is the sandwich sauce.
            </li>
            <li>To assemble sandwiches, sprinkle a little of the sandwich sauce onto each half of the French 
                loaves. Place the roasted mushrooms onto the bottom half of each roll and sprinkle with a little
                 more sauce. Top with a few slices of jalapeno, a few sticks of carrot and radish 
                 (minus the marinade), cucumber, basil and cilantro. Close with the tops of the bread and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
